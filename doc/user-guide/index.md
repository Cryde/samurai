# Samurai

Samurai is a PHP scaffolding tool. You can create new projects or improve exiting ones.

 - Visit [homepage](http://samuraiphp.com/)
 - Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/Raphhh/samurai/)


It helps you to :

 - **start a new project in PHP**, generating all the base files in a simple command line.
 - **improve an existing project**, running several modules with specific actions.

Samurai generates all the files you need for a library, a web application, a frameworked project, and so on. 
You can even **load your own bootstrap**.

Samurai will run several modules during the scaffolding of a new project, or independently on an existing project. 
You can **choose which module** to install according to your own needs. 
You can also create your own module.
